        "\r\n",
        "To analyze importances of different features in our dataset, plot the most important 25 features of the model you trained above in a horizontal bar chart. You can use the plot below for referencing.\r\n",

        "To achieve the colors of the plot, it was built with a certain colormap existing in matplotlib library. To obtain a colormap from matplotlib, you can use `cm.NameOfTheColorMap` and create a colormap instance. You can also pass a `np.linspace` as a parameter to a colormap, with the number of data instances you want to plot. This way, you can create a certain amount of colors to pass as a `color` parameter to the bar chart.\r\n",
