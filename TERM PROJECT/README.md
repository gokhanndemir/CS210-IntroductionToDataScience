Term project on Google Colab with Python, its libraries, maps, and decision tree as an ML(Machine Learning) model using Netflix dataset.

IMPORTANT: Please go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gokhanndemir/CS210-IntroductionToDataScience/blob/master/TERM%20PROJECT/CS210_Final_Report.ipynb.
I want this from you because GitHub doesn't render Folium Maps properly.
