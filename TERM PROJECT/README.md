# CS210-IntroductionToDataScience
Term project on Google Colab using Python, many libraries, maps, and Machine Learning models based on the dataset.

IMPORTANT: Please go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and type URL of CS210_Proj.ipynb file which is https://github.com/gokhanndemir/CS210-IntroductionToDataScience/blob/master/TERM%20PROJECT/CS210_Proj.ipynb
I want this from you because GitHub doesn't render properly Folium Maps.
